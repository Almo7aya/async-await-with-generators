# Async / Await with JavaScript Generators

My experiments with JavaScript Generators to create async/await wrapper with callbacks support 🎉

[Live demo](https://almo7aya.github.io/async-await-with-generators/)

> For anyone that asking about how to pass an argument to the callback functions, You can use [`fn.bind`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_objects/Function/bind) to carry on the arguments
